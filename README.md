## What is this project?

I really like to write about my thoughts and experiences, usually I use my iPad to write my notes,
but then I realized that I could use a blog to share my thoughts and experiences with the world (No one cares about them, but whatever).

## What am I going to write about?

It depends on my interests and what I'm currently working on. But it is usually related about:

1. Software Development / Architecture
2. Philosophy & Life
3. Books in general

## How to run the project?

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website
